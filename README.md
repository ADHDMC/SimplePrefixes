A plugin aiming to allow for simple player-selected prefixes that can be used in chat!

# Requirements

- Paper-based Server (ie: [PurpurMC](https://purpurmc.org/))
  - This plugin takes advantage of Mini-Message from Paper.
- [PlaceholderAPI Plugin](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI)

# Features

- Does not interact with any other plugins directly.
  - The plugin uses and hold prefixes in a placeholder, it will not affect permission groups.
- Supports PlaceholderAPI Placeholders.
- Supports Mini-Message formatting.
- Supports multiple types of requirements: PERMISSION, STATISTIC, ADVANCEMENT, COMPARE_INT

# Placeholders, Commands, and Permissions

`%sp_prefix%`
> Placeholder for the prefix. Use this in your chat plugin.
> 
> Example Usage: `%sp_prefix% %player_displayname% Â» {message}`

`/sp gui`
> Opens a generated GUI that organizes the prefixes by prefix-id.

`/sp reset`
> Resets your prefix.

`/sp set <prefix-id>`
> Sets your prefix.

`/sp reload`
> Reloads the plugin.

# Configuration

```yml
saving-type: "file"
default-prefix: "<white>[<gray>Player</gray>]</white> "

prefix-id:
  display-name: "Prefix ID"
  description:
    - "This is to show an example Prefix!"
    - "This is a second line of description!"
  prefix: "<white>[<rainbow>Something</rainbow>]</white> "
  verify-always: false
  show-when-locked: true
  requirements:
    - "permission simpleprefix.example true"
    - "statistic PLAYER_KILLS >= 10"
    - "advancement nether/summon_wither true"
    - "compare_str %placeholder% == string"
    - "compare_int %placeholder% < 1"
```

## Configuration Settings

| Setting        | Description                                 | Valid Values  |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|
| saving-type    | What type of saving system should this use? | `PDC`, `FILE` |
| default-prefix | Fallback prefix, supports Placeholders.     | String        |

### Saving Types

These are the current implementations of the saving types...

__PersistentDataContainer (PDC)__
> The plugin will save the prefix ID of the currently equipped prefix on the Player themselves.
> This makes the prefix inaccessible while they are offline.
> 
> This was primarily used for initial testing of the plugin but if you don't like file systems for some reason, there.

__YML File (FILE)__
> The plugin will save the prefix IDs of all players to a configuration YML file stored alongside the config.
> This allows for the prefix to be available while they are offline, but any time a player's prefix is changed,
> the plugin saves the prefix.
> 
> This is default.

### Creating Prefixes

`prefix-id`
> This is the Prefix ID. Every prefix is uniquely identified by this value.
> This does mean you cannot have two of the same Prefix IDs.
> 
> The `prefix-id` itself is the value you change. Don't include spaces.

`display-name`
> This is the Display Name of the prefix. It is used as basically the formatted way to display this Prefix.
> 
> Supports Placeholders from PlaceholderAPI.

`prefix`
> This is the String representation of the prefix that will be displayed in place of %sp_prefix%.
>
> Supports Placeholders from PlaceholderAPI.

```yml
# A prefix with the ID "example-prefix"...
example-prefix:
  display-name: "The Example Prefix"
  prefix: "<white>[<rainbow>Example</rainbow>]</white> "
```

### Prefix Requirements

Requirements are things that must be held true in order to equip the prefix.
These requirements come in multiple forms that will be explained here.

> **Note**
> 
> Requirements that are incorrectly formatted or produce errors are ignored.
> 
> Requirements that cannot guarantee failure will not be checked either.
> > To check player permissions, the player has to be online,
> > so while the player is offline, these checks are ignored.
> 
> `verify-always` will make the requirements check every time the player's prefix is requested.
> > If the requirement check fails, the prefix saved is cleared.

<u>**Permission**</u>

Format: `permission <permission.node> [false]`

> 
> `<permission.node>` represents a permission the player may have.
> 
> `[false]` is optional and must be provided to invert the result.
> > This means if the permission is `example.permission`, the player must NOT have this permission.
> 
> <u>Example</u>: `permission example.permission` (Player has permission example.permission)
> 
> <u>Example</u>: `permission example.permission false` (Player does not have permission example.permission)

<u>**Statistic**</u>

Format: `statistic <statistic> <operator> <value>`

>
> `<statistic>` is an enum value from [this page](https://jd.papermc.io/paper/1.19/org/bukkit/Statistic.html).
> This represents some statistic the player has.
>
> `<operator>` is a comparison operator.
> > Valid operators are `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
>
> `<value>` is an integer and can be compared to the statistic.
>
> <u>Example</u>: `statistic ANIMALS_BRED >= 100` (Player has bred 100 or more animals).

<u>**Advancement**</u>

Format: `advancement <namespace:advancement> [false]`

> `<namespace:advancement>` is a Namespaced Key representing an Advancement.
> > You can find vanilla advancements on [this page](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Advancement).
> > This represents some advancement the player can earn. Minecraft Advancements use the `minecraft` namespace.
> 
> `[false]` is optional and must be provided to invert the result.
> > This means that if the advancement is `minecraft:nether/summon_wither`, the player must not have this advancement.
>
> <u>Example</u>: `advancement minecraft:nether/summon_wither` (Player has the Minecraft Summon Wither advancement).
>
> <u>Example</u>: `advancement minecraft:nether/summon_wither false` (Player does not have the Minecraft Summon Wither advancement).

<u>**Compare Int**</u>

Format: `compare_int <placeholder> <operator> <value>`

> `<placeholder>` is any PlaceholderAPI placeholder that can return a valid integer.
>
> `<operator>` is a comparison operator.
> > Valid operators are `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
>
> `<value>` is an integer and can be compared to the placeholder.
>
> <u>Example</u>: `compare_int %player_absorption% > 0` (Player has absorption value greater than 0).
